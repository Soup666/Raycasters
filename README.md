# About the Project

Here lies a project I'm slowly working on during Uni. I hope to document everything so others can learn from this project. The amount of hours put into this learning how C++ works and raycasting algorithms should hopefully be condensed here into a (sorta) easy to follow guide.

The code is commented to a very basic level right now. And the pdf paper's written are old and outdated. Very work in progress :)

Below are some screenshots of the project as of **15/02/2023**.

# Building

The project contains a CMakeLists.txt so can be built and compiled with `cmake . ` If that does work try setting up a `.vscode` and running it that way. Works for me.

Also you'll need SDL2 installed. I am working on a way to bundle it with the project.

Download SDL2 here: https://www.libsdl.org/
